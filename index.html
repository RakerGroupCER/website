            <p>
                The Raker Research Group is composed of chemical education researchers focused on developing tools to assess learning and to evaluate learning experiences in undergraduate chemistry courses. We use a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods to achieve our research goals including survey research methods, structural equation modeling, psychometric evaluations of instrument validity and reliability, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, think-aloud protocols, and response process interviews.

            <h2>
                Our research is centered on four themes:
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Learning in Organic Chemistry</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do learners ascribe meaning to reaction mechanisms?</li>
                        <li>How can we develop tools to measure such learning?</li>
                        <li>How can we design experiences to promote learning of reaction mechanisms and sophisticated reasoning?</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>Learning in Inorganic Chemistry</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do faculty members teaching inorganic chemistry respond to measures of learning and learners' affective experiences when seeking to transform their courses?</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>Faculty Member Professional Development</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do faculty members use assessments and the education research literature when developing and refining their instructional practices?</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>Measurement and Psychometrics</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do we measure non-cognitive learning and affective experiences in the context of chemistry learning?</li>
                        <li>How do non-cognitive and affect measures inform course and program-level assessment?</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
